# Minesweeper

Old classic minesweeper game developed in Python 3 using tkinter. Developed following [this freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/object-oriented-programming-with-python-code-a-minesweeper-game/).

Modifications:
- Added recursion to show all contiguous cells with 0 (zero) mines around them in Cell.show_cell().
